          <h3>Elevate English Podcast</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>This podcast is for intermediate English learners who want something interesting to listen to.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I started this podcast for intermediate learners. Thereâ€™s a lot of content out there to help beginners, and a ton of English media created for native speakers. 
          </p>
          <p>
           Each week I discuss topics like psychology, travel, and history to help you improve your listening comprehension. Full transcripts (written versions) of each episode are available if you want to read along while I talk.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want your opinions! If there is a topic you want me to make an episode about, use the <a href="/contact"> Contact</a> form on my website to let me know. Put "Podcast Idea" as the subject tell me about your ideas.
