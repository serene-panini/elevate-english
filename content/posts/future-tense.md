_Tip_

Sometimes we can use either the will-future or the going to-future and the meaning is the same, but there are differences. See this [post](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/will-or-be-going-to.html) for more examples of the difference, and notice how it is used when you read or listen to content in English.
