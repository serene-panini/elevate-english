## Future Simple
- - -

The future simple is fairly easy to make, and it's very useful. English speakers use this tense (both the will and going to forms) often in everyday life, since it's used to talk about plans, thoughts, and beliefs about the future. This is an important tense to master as an intermediate learner.

Signal Words

:   General future words: tomorrow, next week/month/year, in 2025
:   Opinions/thoughts about the future: I think, I believe


#### Structure 1 Will-Future

will + infinitive

Use

:   Predictions or assumptions about fairly certain events in the future
:   Future actions that happen without the speaker's intention or without the speaker doing anything
:   When you decide to do something at the time of speaking (spontaneously), you did not make the decision before

Affirmative

:   Our team **will win** the game next week.
:   The sun **will rise** tomorrow. (very certain event)

Negative

:   I **won't (will not) help** you today, sorry. (decided in that moment)
:   The Mariner's (a baseball team) definitely **won't (will not)** win tonight. 

Question
:   **Will** you **go** to the party with me next weekend?
:   What **will** you **do** after you finish university?



#### Structure 2 Going to-Future

to be (am/are/is) + going to + infinitive

Use

:   Planned actions in the future
:   When you are certain the action is going to happen, stating a logical consequence to an action (That car is going to crash!)
:   Your opinion, when you think something will happen in the future (it's probably going to rain tomorrow)

Affirmative

Question

:   **Are** you **going to** call me later?
:   **Is** she **going to** write a book someday?

_Tip_

Sometimes we can use either the will-future or the going to-future and the meaning is the same, but there are differences. See this [post](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/will-or-be-going-to.html) for more examples of the difference, and notice how it is used when you read or listen to content in English.

## Future Continuous

The future continuous tense (sometimes called future progressive) isn't always taught in English classes but English speakers use it a lot. You will sound more natural if you learn how to use this tense correctly.

## Future Perfect
- - -

The future perfect tense is only used in a few situations, but for advanced students it's good to know it. I suggest focusing on understanding the tense when you read or hear it. In conversation you can use the future simple or continuous instead.

![future perfect diagram](/uploads/blog/future-perf.png)

Signal Words

:   by
:   for

Use

:   To talk about an action that will finish before a certain time in the future (usually with "by")
:   To describe how long, the duration of an action that started in the past, and will continue to a certain point in the future (usually with "for") Often used to make the 'how long', the duration an easier time to say.

Structure

:   will + have + [past participle](https://www.englisch-hilfen.de/en/grammar/unreg_verben1.htm)

Affirmative

:   She'**ll have (she will have) finished** her homework by 10pm this evening.
:   On Tuesday, I'**ll have lived** here for one year.

Negative

:   They **won't have (will not have) finished cooking dinner** by the time the guests arrive.
:   I **won't have worked** found a job before I graduate university.

Question

:   When **will** I **have finished** this book? (emphasizes the duration of time/specific date more than the simple future "When will I finish this book?")
:   Do you think **he will have** finally **quit** his job by this time next year?

_More Examples_

- When we get married, I'**ll have known** Robert for four years.
- At 4 o'clock, I'**ll have been** in this office for 24 hours.
- By the time I'm sixty, I **will have retired.**
