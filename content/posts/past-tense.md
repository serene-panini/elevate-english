## Past Simple

This is the basic past tense. It's used whenever we want to talk about the past and there isn't a special situation that means we should use the past perfect, present perfect or past continuous. People love to talk about past memories and experiences, so this is a tense to master if you want to start having more conversations in English!

## Past Perfect
- - -

We don't use the past perfect all the time in English, but it is useful, and it sounds very good if you can use it correctly. Once you master the past simple, it's pretty easy to learn this one.

Signal Words

:   already
:   just
:   never

Use

:   When one activity happened before another activity in the past. (past perfect + past simple)
:   The two actions are usually related to each other.

Structure

:   had + [past participle](https://www.englisch-hilfen.de/en/grammar/unreg_verben1.htm)

Affirmative

:   Jane **had read** the book before she watched the movie.
:   I **had** already **lived** in three countries before I met you.

Question

:   **Had** you **studied** much English before you moved to Australia?
:   **Had** they **been** friends before they started dating?

_Tip_

Try to picture the actions on a timeline. Which one happened further in the past? That one takes the past perfect.

## Past Perfect Continuous
- - -

This tense is a little less common, but native speakers still use it to describe the order or duration of events more precisely. This is a good one to understand to improve your reading and listening comprehension. Advanced students should learn how to use this tense correctly. 

![past perfect continuous diagram](/uploads/blog/past-pc.png)

Signal Words

:   how long
:   since
:   for

Use

:   When an action started in the past and continues up until another time in the past. The activity does not continue until now, it stops before the second event.
:   Shows how long something had been happening before something else happened.

Structure

:   had + been + infinitive + ing

Affirmative

:   She **had been working** for years before she got a promotion.
:   They'**d been relaxing** in the park when it started to rain.

Negative

:   He **hadn't been running** for long when he started to feel tired. 
:   They **hadn't been dating** long when they decided to move in together.

Question

:   **Had** you **been studying** a long time before you took the exam?
:   **Had** they **been playing** football outside when the rain started?

_Tip_

This similar to the past perfect, but instead of two finished actions, one event is still in progress up until the other event starts.
