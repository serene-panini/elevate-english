Have you tried reading any books in English? 

Reading is a super effective way to improve your vocabulary. But, it can be incredibly frustrating if you start with a hard book. I’ve been there with French. One time I tried to read the classic “Le Comte de Monte-Cristo” but I had to get out my phone and translate a word every few lines! Not an enjoyable experience. The main problem is that classic, “literary” books are often written in really old-fashioned language. No one speaks like that in real life. 

So put down the Dickens and Austen for now (though they are amazing, you should definitely read them someday!) I’m going to tell you about 10 great books for English learners. Simple language? Check. Interesting story? Check. Only for kids? Nope!

## 1. The Giver by Louis Lowry
- - -
This is one of my all-time favorite books! It’s way more than a young adult book. The story is really thought-provoking. Plus you can watch the Hollywood movie version after!

**Summary:** Meet Jonas, a young boy who thinks he’s living in an ideal world until he’s given his life assignment. He begins to learn about the dark secrets behind his community. Jonas lives in a society with no hunger, war, or even music. It’s governed by extremely strict rules and rigid traditions. What will happen when he realizes his utopian life is actually a dystopia?

**Themes:** individual freedom vs. societal rules, the importance of memory, traditions.

## 2. The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros
- - -
This beautifully written book captures, “the shame of being poor, of being female, of being not-quite-good-enough” according to its author. 

**Summary:** Step into the life of Esperanza Cordero, a young Latina girl growing up in Chicago. The book is written in a series of short stories, sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes joyful. It’s about the feeling of otherness, felt especially strongly in places with deep cultural divides like the United States.

**Themes:** culture, racism, community.

## 3. Animal Farm by George Orwell
- - -
Look! A literary classic that isn’t impossible to read. Jackpot! The main characters speak in short, clear sentences. The author does use some language that isn’t common in everyday life.

**Summary:** The animals of Manor Farm are being exploited by farmer Mr. Jones. The animals decide to rebel against their human master. They want to be free, equal, and happy. The story is a satire which is actually describing life in the Soviet Union during the Stalin era.

**Themes:** power, corruption, leadership. 


## 4. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon
- - - 
A hilarious, wonderful, moving book that can teach us about living with autism. 

**Summary:**  When Christopher discovers the murder of his neighbor’s dog, he decides to launch an investigation. He has Asperger Syndrome, a form of Autism. This can cause difficulty in communication and forming social relationships. Christopher’s explanations for what he observes are clear and logical.

**Themes:** versions of reality, communication.

## 5. The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank
- - -
Personally, I think this is one of the best books of all time. It reminds me that we are all capable of courage in the face of adversity. And that we should be grateful for the people in our lives, even when they’re annoying!

**Summary:** Anne Frank’s remarkable diary is a testament to the human spirit. She records her vivid experiences during the years she and her family spent in hiding in Nazi-occupied Europe. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, and confined spaces to say the least. 

**Themes:** human nature, suffering, hope, love.

And one more, something really unknown that you’ve probably never heard of before…

## The Harry Potter Series by J.K. Rowling
- - - 
This international sensation has been translated into something like 70 languages! If you’ve never read it before, it might be a little bit difficult. But if you’ve read a translation in your native language, give it a try in English. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was one of the first full novels I read in French!

I hope these recommendations are helpful! Have you read any of them before? What are your favorite books in English? Let me know!
